# Banglore-House-Price-Predection
Bangalore House Price Prediction uses machine learning to predict house prices in Bangalore based on various features like location, size, and square footage. The project focuses on data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building regression models to make accurate predictions.

Overview
This project involves building a regression model to predict house prices in Bangalore using a dataset of 13,320 house listings. Key steps include data cleaning, feature engineering, and applying machine learning models such as Linear Regression.

Objectives:
Clean and preprocess the dataset.
Engineer relevant features such as BHK (Bedrooms, Hall, Kitchen) and price per square foot.
Handle outliers and anomalies in the dataset.
Train a regression model to predict house prices.
